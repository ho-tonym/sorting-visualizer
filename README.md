SORT smallest to largest

bubble : compare with each element next to it and swap if it is smaller until it is in the correct spot. so we end up with the largest on the right

selection: go through the array, find the smallest one and swap it with the next element in order in the iteration

insert:

heap:

merge: single threaded, when it is done it flies off the callstack. each recursive function is put on the stack until it is resolved to a value that merge can use
half array over and over until we have 1 element, then it flies off the stack and we call the merge function on it. We make a a comparison of which one is smaller and add that to a temporary array and concat the rest to that array. we do that to the other side of the arguments for that recursive function then keep working our way up until we get the result.

insert: start at position 0, 1. we take a look at 1 and see if it is smaller than 0, if it is swap it. we continue swapping it left until it is in the correct position. so it we are checking index 5, we will theoretically check it against 4,3,2,1,0 until we reach a number that is smaller than array[5], in which case we will stop, since all the elements to the left are correctly sorted.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
